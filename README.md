This project was a college assignment using a TivaC microcontroller to design a small scale traffic light system.
The purpose was to show time delays using the Systick timer in C
This also showed real time synchronization by designing a finite state machine controller.

This project consist of an intersection with traffic lights and a crosswalk.
There are 3 buttons (south, west, and pedestrians) and 8 output lights for the traffic lights and crosswalk lights.
